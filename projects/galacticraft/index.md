Galacticraft is a modification for the video game Minecraft, that adds many new blocks, ores, dimensions and machines to the game. It is a remake of the original [Galacticraft](https://github.com/TeamGalacticraft/Galacticraft-Legacy/) for Minecraft 1.12.2 and below made by [micdoodle8](https://micdoodle8.com/).

I'm a part of the team [TeamGalacticraft](https://github.com/TeamGalacticraft/) working on this project. I've contributed some world/noise generation, many machines, a complex wire/'power distribution' system, networking code, structures, entities and have taken the lead when porting Galacticraft to newer Minecraft versions.

Galacticraft: Rewoven is a modification, or 'plugin' for the video game 'Minecraft', that adds many new blocks, ores, dimensions and machines to the game. It is a remake of the original [Galacticraft](https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/) made by [micdoodle8](https://github.com/micdoodle8/) for the [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/) modding toolchain.

I'm a part of the team [StellarHorizons](https://github.com/StellarHorizons/) working on this project. I've contributed some world/noise generation, many machines, a complex wire/'power distribution' system, networking code, structures, entities and have taken the lead when porting Galacticraft: Rewoven to newer Minecraft versions.
